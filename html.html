     <h3>You can't escape it. Everyone's talking about HTML5. it's perhaps the most hyped technology since people started putting rounded corners on everything and using unnecessary gradients. In fact, a lot of what people call HTML5 is actually just old-fashioned DHTML or AJAX. Mixed in with all the information is a lot of misinformation, so here, JavaScript expert Remy Sharp and Opera's Bruce Lawson look at some of the myths and sort the truth from the common misconceptions.</h3>

        <ul>

          <li>Backwards compatibility, and a clear migration path</li>

          <li>Well-defined error handling, like CSS (i.e. ignore unknown stuff and move on), compared to XML's "draconian" error handling.</li>

          <li>Users should not be exposed to authoring errors.</li>

          <li>Practical use: every feature that goes into the Web-applications specifications must be justified by a practical use case. The reverse is not necessarily true: every use case does not necessarily warrant a new feature.</li>

          <li>Scripting is here to stay (but should be avoided where more convenient declarative mark-up can be used).</li>

          <li>Avoid device-specific profiling.</li>

          <li>Make the process open. (The Web has benefited from being developed in the open. Mailing lists, archives and draft specifications should continuously be visible to the public.)</li>
